      <p>Throughout my internship, I had the privilege of meeting with many amazing
         people. From engineering, to marketing, to product, to people, I gained
         insight into many different parts of the company. I lunched and learned
         with the CEO’s of Zume Pizza as well as Zume Inc., VP’s of Research,
          People, Product, Engineering, and many more. Each person I met was very
          encouraging with stories to tell and advice to give. </p>
      <p>Speaking of meetings, I attended plenty of those. I spent a few days a week
        shadowing the Director of Product Management where I learned about Agile
        Development. While in those meetings, I was able to be a part of the engineering
        teams and learn a lot about what they do on the back end of the business. I grew
        to love the "behind the scenes" part of Zume, the masterminds behind
        the robots. All the coding and hours of bug fixing that went into the final
        product. But I’m getting ahead of myself, more on that later. </p>
      <p> While their jobs all interested me, my favorite part about each meeting
         was how they got to Zume. Different people all from different backgrounds
         working together as <em> ONE TEAM. <em>  </p>
